# aboutme
a brief description of who I am!

👋 Hi, I’m @ohdex

- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about data science and databases. In the future I'd love to manage the creation of systems around providing better business solutions.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the foundation of data science via code academy.  At the end I'll have learnt the full process of data science with python and sql. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anything at the moment. Just looking to gain experience.

- 📫 You can shoot me an email at hi@dexterdasilva.com
